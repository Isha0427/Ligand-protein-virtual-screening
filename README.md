# Ligand-protein-virtual-screening
This project is a deep learning-based web application designed for predicting binding affinity between small-molecule ligands and protein targets. It offers a user-friendly interface for uploading ligand SMILES strings and protein structure files (PDB/FASTA), running virtual screening predictions, and visualizing molecular structures.
